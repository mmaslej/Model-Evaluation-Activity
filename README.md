# Model-Evaluation-Activity

This folder contains three files: 
1. `train.csv`: the training data, a simulated dataset used to train our model
2. `test.csv` the testing data, a simulated dataset used to perform an intersectional bias assessment
3. `BiasAssessmentActivity_Script.R`: R script, containing code to train and evaluate the model and examine the model features
4. `BiasAssessmentActivity_baser.Rmd`: R markdown file, containing same code as above, to train and evaluate the model and examine the model features
5. `BiasAssessmentActivity_tidy.Rmd`: R markdown file, containing similar code to above, to train and evaluate the model and examine the model features. But with some tidyverse syntax.
